# Design Patterns

## OO Principles
* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to an interface, not implementation
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Strategy
Defined a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Observer
Defines a one-to-many  dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically

## Decorator
Attach additional responsabilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending funcitonality

## Simple Factory (not a real design pattern/more of a programming idiom)
